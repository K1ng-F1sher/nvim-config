# Neovim config

This is my current neovim config.
Default location on windows: "~\AppData\Local\nvim\"

Don't forget to install [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) first, in order to get the other plugins working.

Other tools required:
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- [C-compiler](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit)
