# Done (in reverse chronological order)

- Added quickscope.
- Remap `:W` to `:w`, and its friends.
- Removed snippet support from blink, not using it atm.
- Try out snacks explorer
- Added quicker.nvim
- Testing out blink.cmp. Sass wasn't giving autocomplete, but fixed it by configuring the capabilities correctly.
  - Used [TJ](https://github.com/tjdevries/config.nvim/blob/master/lua/custom/plugins/lsp.lua)' and [MariaSolos](https://github.com/MariaSolOs/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/lspconfig.lua)' githubs as inspiration.
- mini.pairs is out. Too much frustration.
- Only set PS as shell when on windows
- Added decent `.mdx` filetype highlighting.
- Can harpoon go back to the last position the cursor was, instead when the mark was made? [YES!](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1apuied/harpoon_go_to_last_cursor_position/?rdt=40866)
- Reorganized plugins.
- Nothing more clever than `<C-w>:q` for closing floating windows.
- Configured pairs: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1ha03xn/minipairs_handle_quotes_neigh_pattern_regex/)
- Added [live-rename](https://github.com/saecki/live-rename.nvim). Removed again, didn't like it. Doesn't add much.
- Changed markdown viewer to [render-markdown](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim)
- Set `vim.opt.undolevels = 10000`, watch if it will ensure undotree show history for a longer time
- Added [Telescope live_grep with args](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-live-grep-args.nvim)
- Added mapping for showing error messages: `gl`
- Turned on linewrap and linenumber in settings
- Added mini.pairs (still a bit unsure whether I'm happy with it)
- Added global `Map` field for `vim.keymap.set`
- Added zen mode
- Added mini.ai
- Implemented snacks dashboard
- Reimplemented PS as shell inside nvim
- Telescope:
  > - Smart path: evaluate in big project whether it's fast enough.
  - Added git_status keymap: `<leader>gs`
  - Added [git advanced search](https://github.com/aaronhallaert/advanced-git-search.nvim) to telescope. Mapped to `<leader>gh`.
  - Different UI for code actions: [here](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ui-select.nvim)
- Silenced some git commands.
- Reimplemented hybrid mode for markview and created a remap for resetting the conceallevel: `<leader>rc`
- Undotree; don't show diff and autofocus.
- Neo-tree: added expand all and disabled backspace
- Hop: changed HopWord remap to `<leader>s`
- Added [leap](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) and made `S` the keymap.
- Bug: conceallevel is set to !0 by the markdown plugin when editing a .md file. This makes json files harder to edit. Possible fix: on buffer leave set conceallevel to 0. Filed bug [here](https://github.com/OXY2DEV/markview.nvim/issues/206) For now removed hybrid mode from config.
- Still sometimes the terminal doesn't clear due to too many shada temp files. Tried an auto cmd on VimLeave.
  - As of now, the terminal is also not cleared, but the shada temp files don't stack up anymore
- Commenting HTML tags in TSX/JSX: https://github.com/folke/ts-comments.nvim
- Added indentation lines: https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim, also reset tab width to 4.
- Find out how to set undotree like Prime [here](https://sidneyliebrand.medium.com/vim-tip-persistent-undo-2fc78a2973a7)? Tried [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1fzgnr3/what_do_you_think_about_neo_vim_on_windows/)
- Added GBrowse for Github and AzureDevops
- Neotree: Event waarop line numbers aangezet kunnen worden: neo_tree_buffer_enter. Fixed, except on initial load, then press `<leader>e` to show line numbers.
- Added remaps for git actions
- Added mini.surround for changing surrounding characters
- Better use of lazy config
- Implemented git signs
- Added pwsh lsp. Got config from [here](https://medium.com/@kacpermichta33/powershell-development-in-neovim-23ed44d453b4)
- Prettier formatter, ideas were:
  - Prettier recommends ALE or NeoFormat or vim-prettier
  - tried neoformat, couldn't get it to work on first attempt
    - lazyvim uses stevearc/conform.nvim
    - should also work: https://github.com/lukas-reineke/lsp-format.nvim
    - none-ls is a basically a copy of the archived null-ls, which has some examples:
      - https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim/wiki/Formatting-on-save
      - https://gist.github.com/majamin/71c19bc463fdbdd55388a1c0e3398c73
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7OguLuaYvE YT showing null-ls
    - Try this: `:%!npx prettier --stdin-filepath %`
    - **In the end I used conform.nvim** [this](https://www.josean.com/posts/neovim-linting-and-formatting) was a great source for the config.
    - Set `vim.opt.conceallevel = 0` to show quotes in JSON files.
- Delete to void register with `<leader>d`, and same with `<leader>p`
- PS as terminal in vim: [source](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/issues/2151) and [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1crdv93/neovim_on_windows_using_windows_terminal_and/)
- Properly set undodir, so undotree really works with history from 'days upon days ago'.
  - Undid it, as it was buggy with undotree.
  - Redid, disabled the history split
- Added `zz` after telescope actions [link1](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim/issues/2115), [link2](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1dpmlhy/comment/lanjro0/)
- Add `$env:TERM='xterm-256color'` to PROFILE
- Added `<leader>pg` for live_grep in project
- Find an `F2` equivalent: `<leader>rn`
- In windows terminal > Settings > Actions > removed Ctrl+V keymap for pasting so visual block mode is available in nvim.
- Also added smartcase (only case sensitive on queries with uppercase characters)
- set ignorecase to true for searching text value. Use `\C` anywhere in the search query to search case sensitive.
- Added [TreeSJ](https://github.com/Wansmer/treesj)
- `:ls` to show opened buffers. A `+` sign indicates unsaved changes.
- Remapped Ctrl+Shift+v for pasting text in terminal (Ctrl+v by default). Can now use `<C-v>` for entering visual block mode.
- Installed mini.files with config gotten from: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/14g36rs/minifiles_navigate_and_manipulate_file_system/)
- `git config --system core.longpaths true` op werk-pc
- Icons for errors/warnings
- Resolve NETRW flickering before showing neo-tree: https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim/issues/1247
- Merged configs for all plugins.
- Exit Harpoon with `<C-C>`, issued [here](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon/issues/609) . Moved to Harpoon2, which has the `close_menu` function.
- Fixed Trouble
- Added lualine
- Show namespace/class/method at the top of page. Removed winbar. Got treesitter-context.
- Implemented lazy.nvim
- Show types in some way (like on hover in vscode) [repo](https://github.com/simrat39/inlay-hints.nvim) and [YT vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYaTzkw3zqQ) Use `K`
- Explorer tree: got neo-tree.
- comment plugin [link](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/41873/how-to-comment-in-vim#:~:text=Select%20several%20lines%20in%20visual,%2DSlash%20to%20comment%2Funcomment.) nvim 0.10 now has `gc` implemented in visual mode.
- Autoformat, use `<leader>f`
- Larger harpoon window [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/169zxkn/is_it_possible_to_make_harpoon_open_on_a_bigger/) (default in harpoon2)
- `<ENTER>` to choose autocomplete rather than `<C-y>`. Solved in lsp config.
- Quick Actions like in vscode: lsp config! (code actions). Also show type with `<S-k>`
- Solved italics being shown [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1ayub43/disable_all_italics_in_nvim_lazyvim_distro/)
- Removed C# from lsp.lua to decrease startup time.
